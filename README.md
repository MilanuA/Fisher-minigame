# Fisher
Fisher is a console-based fishing minigame created in C++.
It is a simple project that I created to practice my C++ skills, especially in object-oriented programming.

This project took me approximately 10 hours over the course of 4 days.

## Installation
To install the project, you need to clone the repository and build the project using CMake.

## Features
- Random fish catching
- Inventory showcase
    - Selling whole inventory
- Shop
    - Rod upgrades
- Level system
    - Some fish can be caught only at certain levels

## Possible future features
- Locations (different fish can be caught in different locations)
- Baits (different baits can be used to catch different fish)
